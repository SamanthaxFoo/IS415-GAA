## In-class Exercise Objectives

In this week's in-class Exercise 1, I explored the setting up of our RStudio and installed all R tools required for this IS314 Geospatial Analytics and Application module.

## Steps Taken in this Exercise

To create this exercise file, I first created a sub-folder under the **`In-class_Ex`** folder and named it **`In-class_Ex1`** and created this Quarto document by executing the following steps:

1.  Click "File" tab
2.  Click "New File"
3.  Under "New File", select "Quarto Document"

> ðŸ”Ž **Observations:** A new file is added in File Explorer with a **`.qmd` file format**. You will need to save the file and label it a name for the file to render and load.

Next, I created the header of this document by adding YAML code that can be indicated using back-ticks ```` ``` <add code here> ``` ````. Within the YAML code, I indicated the document title, writer, publishing date and modifcation date as displayed accordingly in this webpage.
